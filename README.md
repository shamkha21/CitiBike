## Summary  
The dataset "NYC Citibike" provided interesting data. For the first graph, if you refer to (#1) above you can see that most users utulize the bikes within the first hour. This aligns with common knowledge, if an indiviual were to bike for long periods of time they would own a bike instead of renting. There is an incline from 0-10 mins, 10 mins being the peak and then a decline up to around 20 mins than a steady number close to 0. In regards to graph (#2) above, you can see that in males and females the pattern of check out times is similar but males overall check out more number of bikes than females do. Males checked out above 100k, where as females close to 40k. In graph (#3) you can see most users rented bikes between the hours of 6-9 am & 5-8 pm on weekdays and weekends theres a gradual usage of bikes from 10am- 6pm. The logic behind this would be users rent bikes to commute to and back from work during weekdays, and on weekends more indivduals are at their lesiure. In regards to graph (#4) There once again is a similar pattern between male and female riders.
